### Business Statement
------
**Business Problem:** What is the problem?  Why is it a problem?
>  Credit Loan is likely to evaluated mostly based on the banked history and credit usage. Unbanked population could not obtain credit hitory yet or has insufficient amount of credit history. [Home Credit](https://www.homecredit.net/) is the company dedicated to provided lines of credit (loans) to the unbanked population who has a high risk of default. 

**Benefit of a solution**. How will the business benefit from a solution?
> Building a solid repayment abilities prediction model leads to a stable, controllable financial system for Home Credit to identify people, which result in healthier lifecycle for personal loaners who hasn't the financial history yet.

**Success Metrics.** How will stakeholders judge whether the project was a success?
> Success Metrics are evaluated on area under the ROC curve (AUC) between the predicted probability and the observed target.

**Analytics Approach.** What is the general character of the analytics approach to solving the problem? Will a supervised or unsupervised approach be used?  If supervised, is the problem regression or classification?  What is the target variable?
> This project makes use of supervised approach with classification model to predict which application has a repayment abilities based on the previous application histories. The target variable is encoded either 0 or 1, which indicates client with payment difficulties.

**Scope:** What will be delivered and what will be out of scope? What might be added later?
> In scope: 
> Out of scope:

**Details:** Who is going to execute the project? When will the project be finished? Are there important project milestones?
> [Richard Lim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datarichard/) is going to excute this project as a capstone project. the project milestone (calendar) is listed as table below
